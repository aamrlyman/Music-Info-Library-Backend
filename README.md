# Music Info Library Backend 

This is my first ever full stack application. It offers CRUD functionality for all songs created.

## Development
The scaffolding was generated using Django and Django REST Framework and the Data is connected to a MySQL RDS using MySQL Workbench.
 
## CI/CD
I am using github workflows to push changes to the main branch as needed.

## Project Status
This project is feature complete. 

Thanks taking the time to look at my project ðŸ˜Š.
